# AutoFix

AutoFix is a RESTful mobile application created using Ruby on rails to aid with tracking expenses on auto mobile maintenance. This application allows  the user to classify the expenses in a group, based on the repair or maintenance that has been done. The original concept was designed by Gregoire Vella on Behance.
Below is a screenshot of the home page of a signed in user.
